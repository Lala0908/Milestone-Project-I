# BlackJack

My First Milestone project consisted of an HTML, CSS and JS files.

Below is a breakdown of each page.

For HTML: 
link CSS and JS 
create a body with title
a div for dealer 
div for player
add a hit, stay and new game buttons


CSS
style the page a bit
center cards
give it a nice size
capitalize message from JS


JS
JS was the hardest part of the project. After each function, console logging to test the results was what made it make sense. 

I startd by creating a deck. Deck consisted of 52 card.
Creat a deck
also have images of each card and suit.

Then I needed to shuffle the deck. For this I googled an existing formula and used the Fisher Yates algorith. After console logging it, the deck suffled.

The game constists of only 2 players. The 'dealer' and 'you"
create players

The cards then had to be dealt at random. 
deal hands

I then needed to see the cards. 
And the dealer hides one of his cards until the end of the game.
render cards

I then needed to calculate the total points for each player and see who wins. 
render points

Based on the cards dealt, rendered, do the players want to hit or stay. 
create functions for hit and stay

check players points

display winning or losing messages

Make sure all buttons work
